[Microsoft Visual Studio Code (VSC)](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is a code editor. It is the recommended editor for Logger. VSC allows for compile PL/SQL code directly from VSC (see [this blog](https://ora-00001.blogspot.ca/2017/03/using-vs-code-for-plsql-development.html)) for more information.


## Setup

The first time you execute this script an error will be shown and `scripts/user-config.sh` will be created with some default values. Modify the variables as necessary.

*Note: Windows users: Please ensure WSL or cmder is configured to run bash as terminal in VSC: [instructions](../README.md#windows-setup)*

### `tasks.json`

This file defines the VSCode task. The only thing that needs to be modified is the to define a task name. Search the file for `CHANGEME` and replace with the project name.

## Tasks

Tasks can be executed with `âŒ˜+shift+B` and selecting the desired task.

### APEX Export

If you want to export your APEX applications (defined in `scripts/project-config.sh`) execute the `apex export: <project name>`
